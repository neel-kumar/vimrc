# vimrc
This is my personal vimrc. You can use it if you want but don't complain if it breaks something.

# Installing other plugins
Make sure to install Vundle if you choose to use this. The only other plugin that requires extra work to install is ycm which requires you to run install.py in your bundle/YouCompleteMe directory. For more recent instructions, read the documentation.
